(rsyslog/syslog-ng)\n* Cookbook supports client configuration for a single remote server using\n  several protocols.\n* Requires customer maintained remote server for remote logging.\n\n== SETUP:\n\n* Place <tt>logging::default</tt> recipe into your runlist to setup the logging resource. When\n  using a RightScale ServerTemplate, this will also automatically configure\n  logging service provider (rsyslog/syslog-ng). If a remote server is specified the default\n  recipe will determine the logging provider installed (rsyslog/syslog-ng)\n  and configure it for remote logging.\n* To setup a logging server, place the following recipes in order to your runlist:\n\n    logging_<provider>::setup_server\n      sets up the logging provider.\n\n    logging::install_server\n      sets up generic server inputs and configures a logging server.\n\n  For example: To set up and install an rsyslog logging server\n\n    logging_rsyslog::setup_server\n    logging::install_server\n\n== USAGE:\n\n1. Local Logging - Set the 'logging/remote_server' input to 'ignore' to use\n   the default configuration installed.\n2. Remote Logging - Set the 'logging/remote_server' input to the FQDN or IP of the\n   designated remote logging server to adjust the default configuration to the remote\n   logging configuration.\n3. Transfer protocol - Set the 'logging/protocol' input to one of the listed options:\n   1. UDP: the most generic and common-used option. UDP is the default logging protocol option.\n   2. RELP: RELP stands for Reliable Event Logging Protocol.\n      RELP ensures that no message is lost, not even when connections break and a peer becomes unavailable.\n   3. RELP-secured: while using RELP to ensure a safe and loss-free transmission between two machines\n      the traffic also gets encrypted with an SSL certificate the user should provide with the\n      'logging/certificate' input. As stunnel is configured with the \"verify = 3\" option the server\n      would require and verify the client certificate against the locally installed certificate\n      providing client authentication.\n\n== DETAILS:\n\n=== General\n\nThe 'logging' interface is defined by a Lightweight Resource, which can be found in\nthe <tt>resources/default.rb</tt> file.\n\nThis cookbook is intended as a framework for logging providers. The current\nimplementation supports the minimum configuration for rsyslog and syslog-ng.\n\nNote: This cookbook does not modify the installed logging provider.\n\nFor more information about Lightweight Resources and Providers (LWRPs), please see: {Lightweight Resources and Providers}[http://support.rightscale.com/12-Guides/Chef_Cookbooks_Developer_Guide/08-Chef_Development/Lightweight_Resources_and_Providers_(LWRP)]\n\n=== Providers:\n\nThe current implementation does not support providers other than rsyslog and syslog-ng.\n\n=== Custom Configuration:\n\nBy using an override cookbook the default configuration can be customized by replacing\nthe default configuration file template for the provider. For more information, \nplease see: {Override Chef Cookbooks}[http://support.rightscale.com/12-Guides/Chef_Cookbooks_Developer_Guide/08-Chef_Development/Override_Chef_Cookbooks].\n\n== LICENSE:\n\nCopyright RightScale, Inc.
