The name of the existing CLB is provided as an input. The application\nserver is then associated with the CLB on Rackspace. Administrators create and\nedit CLBs using the Rackspace web interface.\n\n== REQUIREMENTS:\n\n* Requires a virtual machine launched from a RightScale-managed RightImage\n\n* Requires an existing Rackspace Cloud Load Balancer\n\n== SETUP/USAGE:\n\n=== Application Server Attach\n\n==== do_attach_request\n\nThis recipe is used by application servers to request that a Rackspace CLB\nattach the application server to its configuration. The recipe sends\nthe server's internal IP address as a parameter to the CLB.\n\n=== Application Server Detach\n\n==== do_detach_request\n\nThis recipe is used by application servers to request that a Rackspace CLB\ndetach the application server from its configuration. The recipe sends the\nserver's internal IP address as a parameter to the CLB. Note: If this is the\nonly application server in the CLB configuration, it will not detach. This is a\nknown limitation of Rackspace CLB, and is disallowed in the Rackspace web\ninterface as well.\n\n== KNOWN LIMITATIONS:\n\n* If an application server is the only attached item for a CLB, it cannot be\n  detached. This appears to be by design, as attempting to do this manually from\n  the Rackspace web interface also fails.\n\n== LICENSE:\n\nCopyright RightScale, Inc. All rights reserved.
